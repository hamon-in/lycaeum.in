<Kazmik> studying at nss palakkad
<riaz> hi
<Kazmik> we can do this in windows right?
<nase> I'm Naseeha From Calicut, studying at NSSCE Palakkad  [14:51]
<Kazmik> i installed python here
<Kazmik> i mean in windows
<riaz> i'm on ubuntu
<Kazmik> will that be enough?
<Khmar> I'm not sure. I haven't tested the course on Windows.
<Kazmik> currently dont have linux in ma lap
<Khmar> Make sure that you have atleast this much running
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-4
								        [14:52]
<Kazmik> ohh
<Khmar> nase: Were you the one who sent the email to the group?
<Kazmik> about that..  [14:53]
<Kazmik> i dont understand how to setup enviorment
<nase> yeah.  [14:54]
<Kazmik> it shows some error when i type in that command
	 . /etc/bash_completion.d/virtualenvwrapper
<Khmar> Well, is Python running?
<Kazmik> ya
<Khmar> Kazmik: That won't work on Windows.
<Kazmik> so ? what should i do?
<Khmar> That's a UNIX shell script. Virtualenvwrapper will not work on
	windows.
<Kazmik> i mean thats needed for this course?
<Khmar> Kazmik: Look through https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv and
	install Virtualenv.  [14:55]
<Khmar> Make sure that works first.
<Khmar> There's also some useful help at
	https://zignar.net/2012/06/17/install-python-on-windows/
<Khmar> Please look through those and get it working. 
<Kazmik> oki  [14:56]
<riaz> w8 w8... is this workshop is on windows??
<Khmar> riaz: Nope. It's on Linux. Kazmik has Windows.
<riaz> ooh ok
<riaz> i created virtual environment  in the name natgeo  [14:57]
<Khmar> Cool.
<nase> I'm on linux mint.  [14:58]
<Khmar> nase: Should be fine. Were you able to do the setup?
<nase> yeah
<Khmar> Kazmik: It's a pain to do any serious development on Windows so I
	think it's best you either shift to Linux or atleast install it inside
	a VM like Virtualbox or vmware. 
<Khmar> Kazmik: How's it going?   [15:01]

*** riaz_ (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has joined
    channel #thelycaeum
<Khmar> So, welcome everyone.
<Khmar> welcome back riaz_ 
<Khmar> Just starting.  [15:29]
<Khmar> This is a quick introduction to the Python programming language. 
<Khmar> We're not going to cover *everything* but enough to give you some
	starting points.
<Khmar> We're going to write a small program
<Khmar> It's described here
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html
<Khmar> The idea is to pick the National Geographic Picture of the day and
	then use that as our wallpaper.  [15:30]
<Khmar> Makes sense?
<Khmar> This is the page
	http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/
<Khmar> Hello?  [15:31]
<nase> yeah
<Kazmik> yeah
<anzen516> ok, good
<Khmar> anzen516: What's your name?
<Khmar> And where are you from?  [15:32]
<anzen516> I'm ajoy
<anzen516> studied at gec tcr, now at tvm, preparing for gate
*** riaz__ (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has joined
    channel #thelycaeum
<Khmar> Now, Python like most languages comes with a "standard library"
<Khmar> Just like C and Java.
*** riaz_ (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has quit: Ping
    timeout: 250 seconds  [15:33]
<Khmar> The standard library is usually available at /usr/lib/python-2.7
	(depending on your version number)
<Khmar> Take a look. You'll see a lot of .py and .pyc files. 
<Kazmik> yes
<Khmar> Sorry.. /usr/lib/python2.7 (no -)
<Khmar> These are files which are part of Python itself. i.e. if you install
	Python, you'll automatically get all this.  [15:34]
<Khmar> This is similar to C's "printf". 
<Khmar> You don't have to separately install that to get it working. 
<Khmar> Makes sense?  [15:35]
<nase> yea
<riaz__> yeah
<riaz__> carry on
<Khmar> Okay. Now, we need a few extra libraries to get our program to work. 
<Khmar> One is a library called "requests" which is an HTTP client. We can use
	this to fetch the page.  [15:36]
<Khmar> The second is a library called "BeautifulSoup" which we can use to
	parse the HTML which we get from the site. 
<Khmar> These are not part of the standard library. 
<nase> ok
<Khmar> There are many ways to install these. One (bad) way is to download the
	files and put them inside the standard library. This is messy for many
	reasons.   [15:37]
<Khmar> You'll mess up the stdlib (short for Standard library).
<Khmar> You need administrator access to do this.
<Khmar> You can't maintain these libraries (some might be unstable)
<anzen516> ok. go on  [15:39]
<Khmar> So, we use virtualenv.
<Khmar> This is a tool that can create small isolated environments. 
<Khmar> We can install libraries inside these environments without any issues.
<Khmar> So, for example, if we have one project A, this can use libraries
	b-0.5, c-0.7 and d-1.0
<Khmar> Another project B can use libraries b-0.5, c-0.8, d-2.0  [15:40]
<Khmar> And both of these can coexist without messing each other up.
<Khmar> This allows us to keep project requirements separate.
<Khmar> and manage things more easily.
<Khmar> virtualenv is the tool that helps us create these "virtual
	environments"
<nase> it is used for python only?
<Khmar> nase: Yes but most high level languages have something similar. 
								        [15:41]
<Khmar> ruby has rbenv and rvm
<Khmar> etc.
<nase> ok.
<Khmar> virtualenvwrapper gives us some convenient functions for virtualenv. 
<anzen516> so virtualenv creates an env so  that the project uses the stdlib +
	   virtualenv.
<Khmar> Like "mkvirtualenv" (to create a new one), "workon" (to switch to a
	virtualenv).  [15:42]
<Khmar> etc.
<Khmar> anzen516: Yes.
<Khmar> That's what we're doing here. First mkvirtualenv (to create a
	virtualenv).
<Khmar> In your prompts, try typing "workon natgeo".
<Khmar> Then try typing "which python"  [15:43]
<Khmar> It will give you the path of the interpreter inside a virtualenv
<Khmar> After that, try typing "deactivate"
<Khmar> and then "which python" again, it will give you the default system
	python.
<Khmar> Tried it?  [15:44]
<nase> yeah
<Khmar> Can you see it?
<nase> it shows the path outside
<nase> /usr/bin/python  [15:45]
<riaz__> yeah /usr/bin/python
<Khmar> You understand how it changed when you were inside and outside the
	virtualenv?
<riaz__> yes
<Khmar> Let's move on then.  [15:46]
<nase> yea
<anzen516> yes, got it!!!
<riaz__> k
<Khmar> Now, we install two libraries using pip
<Khmar> requests (HTTP client) and BeautifulSoup4 (HTML parser).
<riaz__> actually what is pip??
<Khmar> This is donw using "pip" (which is the Python library installer).
<Khmar> This is done using "pip" (which is the Python library installer).
<riaz__> ok
<Khmar> pip is a tool that's used to install 3rd party libraries.   [15:47]
<nase> ok
<Khmar> I should say "manage" (instead of install) libraries.
<Khmar> Since it can install/upgrade/uninstall etc.
<riaz__> ok
<Khmar> Think of it like a apt-get specific to Python.
<nase> ok
<Khmar> It will search pypi.python.org for packages and download/install them
	onto your system.
<Khmar> So, we install requests and BeautifulSoup4  [15:48]
<anzen516> ok
<Khmar> Now, let's write a simple program to fetch the page.
<Khmar>
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-5
<nase> ok
<Khmar> Create a file called ng_pod.py (for national geographic picture of the
	day)
<Khmar> and put the code in that section inside  [15:49]
<Khmar> Let me know when you're done.
<nase> yeah  [15:50]
<Khmar> Let me explain it now.
<nase> ok  [15:51]
<Khmar> The first line "import requests" is similar in some sense to the
	#include of C.
<Khmar> It makes the requests library available to our program.
<Khmar> However, in Python when you say "import x", you have to refer to all
	functions in the library as x.func
<Khmar> Not just func.
<Khmar> It would be like as if you had to say stdio.printf in C.  [15:52]
<Khmar> This is called namespacing.
<anzen516> got it
<Khmar> The next line (def ...) defines a function.  [15:53]
<riaz__> ok
<Khmar> The name of the function is fetch_url, The argument is a url stored
	int he variable url
<Khmar> Just after the function heading is a string "Fetches the page with the
	given url and returns the body."  [15:54]
<Khmar> 
<Khmar> This is called a "docstring". 
<Khmar> It's the documentation for the function.
<Khmar> And will be available to us in the program.
<Khmar> The body of the function (and of all blocks in general) is defined by
	indentation (not by {} like in C).
<Khmar> So, if you notice, all the statements that I want to put inside the
	function are indented by a few spaces to the right.   [15:55]
<Khmar> Makes sense?
<anzen516> yes
<riaz__> yes
<Khmar> If you don't align all the statements properly, Python will complain
	of a syntax error and abort.
<nase> yea
<riaz__> ok
<nase> ok
<Khmar> The body is quite simple.   [15:56]
<Khmar> We call the `get` function inside the requests module
<Khmar> and pass to it the url which we get.  [15:57]
<Khmar> The return value will have a "content" attribute. That will contain
	the actual body of the HTTP response.
<Khmar> We return this.
<Khmar> Not very complicated. Does it make sense?
<riaz__> yeah
<nase> yea
<Khmar> Now, try running this.  [15:58]
<Khmar> Save the file and start python
<Khmar> then say import ng_pod
<Khmar> and then ng_pod.fetch_url("http://....")
<Khmar> Like in the notes.
<Khmar> You'll notice it freeze for an instant as it fetches the URL  [15:59]
<Khmar> and then you'll get the value back in the variable body.
<anzen516> ng_pod
<Khmar> Yes
<riaz__> error :(  [16:00]
<Khmar> What's the error?
<nase> error
<riaz__> no module named requests
<Khmar> Is your virtualenv activated?
<nase> the same as showed before.
<Khmar> did you say workon natgeo before starting python?
<nase> no module named requests
<riaz__> yep (natgeo)riaz@xanium:  [16:01]
<Khmar> riaz__: Then do a pip install requests
<nase> oh,no
<nase> now it works for me
<Khmar> Good  [16:02]
<Khmar> http://pastebin.com/Sb8Qd9TB
<Khmar> riaz__: ?  [16:03]
<riaz__> yeah working  [16:04]
<Khmar> Okay.
<anzen516> it worked
<Khmar> Can you try running the program then? You should see the HTML output.
<Khmar> Works?  [16:05]
<riaz__> import ng_pod works fine
<riaz__> but  ng_pod.fetchurl not working  [16:06]
<Khmar> fetch_url
<Khmar> That's the name we used in the file. 
<riaz__> yes  [16:07]

<anzen516> i think pip might not have worked. You would have to use sudo.
<Khmar> anzen516: Don't use sudo.
<Khmar> That will install requests inside the system path and corrupt it.
<anzen516> i had to use sudo :(
<Khmar> *Never* use sudo unless you know what exactly you're doing.

<Khmar> anzen516: That's because you ran it without activating your
	virtualenv.
<anzen516> oh!
<Khmar> riaz__: What's the output of "whcih python"
<Khmar> riaz__: What's the output of "which python"  [16:18]
<Khmar> Welcome back nase 
<Khmar> riaz__: Can you respond quickly? We're wasting time.
<nase> oh.problem with network.Did i miss something?  [16:19]
<Khmar> nase: Did the program work for you? Were you able to see the HTML
	output?
<nase> im working on it. lost connection  [16:20]
<Khmar> okay
<Khmar> Let me know if it works for all of you.  [16:21]
<Khmar> anzen516: You shouldn't use sudo for anything unless you know that you
	need system administrator privileges.

    #thelycaeum
<nase> yea
<nase> it works
<Khmar> anzen516: The whole idea of using virtualenv (like I mentioned before)
	is to avoid needing that in the first place.
<anzen516> ok, i uninstalled both, and installed it in my env  [16:22]
<Khmar> anzen516: You can create small environments inside your own
	environment and deal with it there.
<Khmar> riaz: ?
<Khmar> riaz: Did it work for you? 
<Khmar> Okay. now, we don't want to run this program like this by first typing
	import and then running the fetch_url function  [16:24]
<Khmar> We'd like to simply say "python ng_pod.py" and it should do its work.
<Khmar> But if you try that from the shell, you'll see that it doesn't do
	anything.
*** riaz_ (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has joined
    channel #thelycaeum
<Khmar> This is because the program simply defines the fetch_url function but
	doesn't actually call it.
<Khmar> Makes sense?
<riaz_> yeh working..
<anzen516> yes
<nase> ok  [16:25]
<Khmar> So, we can change it to directly call fetch_url in the code itself
	like I've done in the 3rd program under "Fetch the page"
*** riaz (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has quit: Ping
    timeout: 250 seconds
<Khmar> But the problem with that is that it will actually call the fetch_url
	function even when we import the file. This is bad.  [16:26]
<Khmar> What we're like is to run the function only if we directly execute the
	program. If we import, we don't want it to do anything. Correct?
<anzen516> yes  [16:27]
<nase> yea
<riaz_> yes
<Khmar> When we import a module (which is the python term for a library), a
	variable called __name__ will be created.  [16:28]
<Khmar> __ is two underscores (Shift -)
<Khmar> If a module (say ng_pod) is imported, __name__ will be "ng_pod"
<Khmar> If a module is directly run from the command line, __name__ will be
	"__main__"
<Khmar> So, we put an "if" statement in the file.  [16:30]
<Khmar> if __name__ == "__main__":
<Khmar>    fetch_url(...)
<Khmar> this will run only if the module was directly run from the command
	line.
<nase> okay
<Khmar> If we import it, the __name__ will be "ng_pod" so it run the fetch_url
	function.  [16:31]
<Khmar> Does that make sense?
<Khmar> This is a common python trick.
<anzen516> yes
<Khmar> The next thing we're doing is parsing the actual document. For that,
	we write a get_image_url function.  [16:32]
<Khmar> Please interrupt me if you don't understand. We wasted a lot of time
	today and I'd like to wrap up by 1700.
<Khmar> The function is similar to the one we already wrote.
<Khmar> It has a def header and then a docstring.
<Khmar> In Python, if you want to make a multiline string, you can use """ or
	'''  [16:33]
<Khmar> (triple quotes)
<Khmar> The function receives some HTML output.
*** riaz_ (75c9f6ff@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.201.246.255) has quit: Ping
    timeout: 250 seconds
<Khmar> You can see a new import statement on the top
<Khmar> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup4
<Khmar> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
<anzen516> yes  [16:34]
<Khmar> This is similar to the other statement but makes the BeautifulSoup
	object availabe in the current namespace.
<Khmar> So we can simply say BeautifulSoup instead of bs4.BeautifulSoup
<Khmar> In the function, we create a soup object by called BeautifulSoup with
	the HTML input  [16:35]
<Khmar> soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
<Khmar> The image is the "img" tag inside the first "div" tag with class =
	"primary_photo". We find this by reading the page source once.
<Khmar> The code finds the first <div class="primary_photo">
<Khmar> and then gets the "img" tag from inside that and then gets the src
	attribute from that. This is the actual image.  [16:36]
<Khmar> We return this URL.
<Khmar> Does that make sense?
<nase> yea
<anzen516> yes  [16:37]
<Khmar> We also add some code inside the if __name__... block
<Khmar> to actually call the get_image_url  [16:38]
<Khmar> function
<Khmar> If you run this program, It will print the URL to the image.
<Khmar> The next stage, we actually fetch this image. We can do this using the
	fetch_url function.  [16:39]
<Khmar> So, we add some code to dot hat.
<Khmar> You can see it here
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-5_3
<Khmar> You'll see some new code there which uses the "with" statement. See
	it?  [16:40]
<nase> yea
<Khmar> The with statement creates a context which can have some extra
	variable bindings. When you leave the context, the bindings will
	automatically be removed. 
<Khmar> When we say `with open("image.jpg") as f:`, it will open the file
	"image.jpg" and make the variable f point to the file handle.
								        [16:41]
<Khmar> When we exit the block, it will automatically close the file handle.
<Khmar> This is a neater way of writing something like
<Khmar> f = open("image.jpg", "wb")
<Khmar> f.write(data)
<Khmar> f.close()
<Khmar> It's neater to say  [16:42]
<Khmar> with open("image.jpg", "wb") as f:
<Khmar>    f.write(data)
<Khmar> Make sense?
<nase> yeah.
<Khmar> You'll often find things in Python like
<Khmar> with get_lock():
<Khmar>    Run_function()
<Khmar> or maybe
<Khmar> with log_set(0):  [16:43]
<Khmar>   # Run without logging
<Khmar>   function()
<Khmar> etc.
<nase> ok  [16:44]
<Khmar> Try running the program.
<anzen516> ok
<Khmar> You should see an image.jpg in the directory.  [16:45]
<anzen516> file saved
<anzen516> image downloaded and saved
<Khmar> nase: ?  [16:46]
<Khmar> The next step is to actually set the background.  [16:47]
<Khmar> For this, if you're using a normal desktop manager (not the new Ubuntu
	thing), you can set it using the `qiv` command
<Khmar> Let's write a new function set_desktop_background -
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-5_4
								        [16:48]
<Khmar> The python standard library module "subprocess" allows us to run
	external commands.
<Khmar> So, we first create the command we want to run command = "qiv --root_s
	%s"%image_file  [16:49]
<Khmar> The %s inside the "" is substituted by the image_file variable after
	the %
<Khmar> It's similar to how C's sprintf works
<Khmar> The subprocess module has a function called "call" which can run a
	program. It requires the program to be passed as a list rather than a
	string.  [16:50]
<Khmar> So ["qiv", "--root_s", "image.jpg"] instead of "qiv --root_s
	image.jpg".
<Khmar> Strings have a "split" method which will split them into strings at
	whitespaces.  [16:51]
<anzen516> its not working! OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory. Is
	   it because i have ubuntu 12.04 with unity?  [16:52]
<Khmar> anzen516: Install qiv first.
<anzen516> ok
<Khmar>
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-3
<Khmar> And we add some code to the if __name__... part to actually run this
								        [16:54]
<anzen516> no errors, but the background has not been set
<Khmar> Ubuntu?
<Khmar> Unity?
<anzen516> yes, 12.04  [16:55]
<anzen516> yes, unity
<Khmar>
	http://askubuntu.com/questions/66914/how-to-change-desktop-background-from-command-line-in-unity
<Khmar> 
<Khmar> Ubuntu is not very developer friendly so you'll have to figure out
	another command that works there.
<Khmar> But that's just once part of the program to change. 
<anzen516> ok.. i'll tell you when i get it  [16:56]
<Khmar> Let's move on.
<Khmar> Now the if __name__ part has grown quite a bit.
<Khmar> We can move all that into a "main" function. 
<Khmar>
	http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-5_5
<Khmar> And then simply call "main" inside the if __name__ part.
<Khmar> MAkes sense?  [16:59]
<anzen516> yes
<Khmar> We use the sys module to exit once we have a return value.
<Khmar> sys.exit returns back to the system the value whcih was passed into
	it.  [17:00]
<Khmar> the main function returns 0 on no error 
<Khmar> and we get send it back to the OS.
<Khmar> Fine?  [17:01]

The Calendar below has my current bookings and public workshops. If you want me to deliver a workshop at your college, please pick an empty slot and drop me an email at noufal at thelycaeum dot in to schedule it. If you're curious about a workshop listed below (e.g. if you want to attend), please email me and we'll see what we can do.

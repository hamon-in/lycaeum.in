I'm planning to conduct an online training on basic Python sometime this month. The tentative date is 14 of September (Saturday). I have a [registration form](http://bit.ly/lycaeum-python-workshop) which you should fill up if you're interested. I'm giving preference to college students from Kerala. I don't think I can handle more than 15 students so entry is limited.

There's also a [facebook page for the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1413281435561662/) which you can use to let your friends know about the one day workshop.

We will do a basic course and then, if there's sufficient interest, conduct more in the future. My intention is to gauge interest and to check whether the tools available are sufficient to conduct something like this.

Please spread the word.

*Update:*

This course was concluded on 14 Sep 2013. The notes and IRC transcript are available at

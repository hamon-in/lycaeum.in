*Updated on 15/Sep/2014 - The session was concluded and code is put online.*
*Updated on 8/Sep/2014 - The session will be on the 14 of Sep (and not 13 as initially announced).*

I had blogged earlier about public sessions on topics of general
interest. The first such one is ready and it's on game programming.

It'll be around 3 hours long. I'm planning to cover some basics of 2D
games like sprites, input control, simple AI, graphics, sounds etc.

This will use Python + PyGame.

The session will be on the 14th of September 2014 at [The Lycaeum](http://thelycaeum.in/contact.html).

The current plan is to do it from 10:00 to 13:30. Please subscribe the [mailing list](http://thelycaeum.in/resources.html) to stay notified about changes.

If you're interested, please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1guydgZMTtsqNd25vU8tbut9L2j51ej52cD-ieoT8np0/viewform). The number of seats are limited so please don't fill in the form unless you're sure you're coming.

See you there!

*Update:* This session was concluded on 14/Sep and the code is available at [https://github.com/TheLycaeum/pygame](https://github.com/TheLycaeum/pygame).

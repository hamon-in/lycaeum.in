The last time I conducted [this course](http://thelycaeum.in/blog/2013/09/04/online_course_on_basic_python), it went quite well. I'm planning to do it every weekend for a month (i.e. till mid 12/October) and see how it goes.

It will be conducted from 1500 to 1700. The last time, we did it at 1630 but that was a little inconvenient and we had to stop a little early. We tried video but it wasn't too good so we'll stick to IRC. The IRC server is `irc.freenode.net` and the channel is `#thelycaeum`. It's best you use a proper IRC client but if you're having trouble installing it, you can use [http://webchat.freenode.net/](http://webchat.freenode.net/). My nick on the server is `Khmar`.

The course notes and setup instructions are [over here](http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html). Please make sure that you've installed the software specified [there](http://thelycaeum.in/online-workshops/python-14-Sep-2013/python-14-sep-2013.html#sec-3). We don't want to waste time messing with the setup.

I'll post further details on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/the-lycaeum/) and on the [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/thelycaeum). Please subscribe there to stay upto date. There's also a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Lycaeum/551173768266575) if that's what you prefer.

See you all there!

I'm planning a public session on [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) and
related concepts on the 22nd of this month. I'm hoping to introduce a
few basic ideas about cryptography like encryption - symmetric and
asymmetric, public key cryptography, web of trust etc.

We'll also cover some material on Certificate authorities and
how these concepts work when using https for transmitting data over
the web. We'll try to incorporate a few simple exercises so that
you're comfortable working with the technologies yourself.

In this day and age, these concepts are becoming important and it's
useful for people to have atleast a basic understanding of how these
technologies work.

The session will be conducted at
[The Lycaeum](http://thelycaeum.in/contact.html). Entry is free but
please [register](http://goo.gl/forms/yIlgvwSmCS) since seats are
limited. We'll start in the morning around 9:30 am and go till around
13:00. Depending on whether there's interest, we can add a post lunch
session.

See you all there!

I conducted a short 2 day workshop at NIELIT Calicut on 10 and 11
October 2015. The Ipython notebook which I used to jot down the basics
is viewable 
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/TheLycaeum/nielit-python-intro/blob/master/Basic%20Python.ipynb).

The repository with all the code that was written including the chat
server is available on
[Github](https://github.com/TheLycaeum/nielit-python-intro).

[lycaeum mailing list](http://thelycaeum.in/resources.html).

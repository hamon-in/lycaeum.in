(If you've already read the post but just want to register, head over to the [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/xBJWxpvvfbDrRhUm2).)

This is the 6th batch of the mentoring program that I'm conducting at The Lycaeum. If you're interested, please fill in the following form.

The registration will close on 31/Jul/2017 and the classes will start on 7/Aug/2017.

The contents are as follows. **Please note that these have been updated since the last course**.

### Duration and timings

The course will start on 7/Aug/2017 and will take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 15:30 to 17:00.
The course will run for approximately 3.5 months and will get over in mid to late November. The dates and times can be adjusted depending on the convenience of the students.

### Time table

There will be some ongoing activities like regular blogging, presentations about work done in front of the rest of the students etc. to encourage presentation skills.

#### *Part 1* : Basics
The first part of the course covers basic skills that are useful to any programmer. Some of the topics that will be covered are basic UNIX, a programmers editor (Emacs), Version control (Git), Programming languages (C and Python).

#### *Part 2* : Systems project
This is a small project to build a low level system to understand the computer at a systems level. We will build a small linux distribution from scratch. This will familiarise people with how a computer is organised and how things work at a low level.

#### *Part 3* : Application project
This is a small sized project to get people familiar with design and development of a program. The general idea is to break the students into teams of 2 or 3 (preferably across colleges) and then to spend some time discussing design, trade offs and other such issues and then to finally have the students work on the project with constant feedback and criticism. The plan is to let people make mistakes and then face up to how those mistakes affect the project as a whole rather than the guide people to avoid errors. Issues like testing, documentation etc. will be covered here

At the end of this, all teams will have to present their project along with design decisions and functionality to everyone else.

#### *Part 4* : Code comprehension
This is a smaller project where the students are given a medium sized project with a request to add an feature or fix a bug. They'll have to study the project and then make the requested change. This will give students the confidence to read and understand someone elses code.

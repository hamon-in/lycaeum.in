I'm giving a talk on the Interactive fiction authoring system called [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/). I wrote a small game to explore some of the interesting ideas in the language.

I've published it using a javascript interpreter over [here](http://thelycaeum.in/resources/kraal/). You can play it in your browser or download the compiled file and play it using a native interpreter like [gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/). Enjoy. And for all of you who want to see the source, I've added it below. You can see the semi-natural language style of doing things. The emphasis is on narrative rather than other aspects of programming.

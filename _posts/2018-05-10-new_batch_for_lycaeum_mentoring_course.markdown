I'm planning a new batch for my mentoring course starting July 2 2018
The course will last for four months this time to accommodate an extra
project. To register, please use the form at <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gmOnJWs3hMknPwD83">https://goo.gl/forms/gmOnJWs3hMknPwD83</a>.


The rough syllabus is as follows

<table>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Basics </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2">  We will use this month to learn basic skills that all programmers need. Specifically - typing, basic UNIX, editors and version control. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Programming </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2"> The first week, we'll use to get familiar with the Python programming language. After that, we'll have a series of exercises to get familiar with the language. There will be testing, debugging, understanding existing code to extend programs etc. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Systems project </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2">This is a small project to build a low level system to understand the computer at a systems level. We will build a small linux distribution from scratch. This will familiarise people with how a computer is organised and how things work at a low level.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Individual project </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2"> This is a small project. A separate one for each student so that they can hone their skills. I will give you several options and you have to work on of them from beginning to end. I will guide your progress and make sure that you develop the entire thing. You'll have to develop, document, and test the project. 
<br/>
You will have to present the project to the whole team at the end of the period.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Group project </th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2"> This is a larger project where all students will have to work as a team to develop the entire project. I will act as a customer/project manager who you have to get requirements from and then develop the entire thing through a collaborative process.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="h1"> Code comprehension</th>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td colspan="2"> This is a smaller project where the students are given a medium sized project with a request to add an feature or fix a bug. They'll have to study the project and then make the requested change. This will give students the confidence to read and understand someone elses code.
</td>
</tr>

title: "The Lycaeum mentoring course in now a software bootcamp"
---

We've been running the software mentoring course successfully for 9 batches. Due to high level of interest from the students and companies, we've expanded the program into a longer bootcamp and reworked to syllabus based on industry feedback. 

We're including some modules that teach students basic web development and devops. We've also increased the number of programming projects and exercises. The center is moving to a larger facility and we're in a position to accommodate more students as well. 

The next batch for the program will start in September 2019 and feature a new syllabus.

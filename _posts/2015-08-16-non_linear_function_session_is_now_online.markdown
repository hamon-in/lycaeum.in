Firstly, I've extended the registration dates for the mentoring course
to the end of September 2015. Classes will start in the first week of
October 2015. If you're interested, please
[sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mNhkJBRGzT_oQWD4QFeJddXwa9PYBKKQQ-ifj9sbqBs/viewform).

And, I've made a screencast of the previous session on non linear functions
and put it up online on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfqBFwU2dbc&list=PLLw1baohKZGKchYtC0l4gCMelfGSlyREy&index=2).

<p>The Lycӕum is an experimental educational endeavour started in 2013. It is currently based in Kozhikode, Kerala and focusses (for now) on IT education.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_(Classical)">The original Lycӕum</a> was a school founded by the great Greek philosopher Aristotle in 335 BC. We aim to kindle the same interest in learning and personal growth that it did. </p>

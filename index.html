Just the way the famous Athenian master Aristotle and prominent philosophers of the times used the Lycaeum as a center of debate and pursuit of knowledge, the Lycaeum was established in 2013 in Kozhikode, Kerala to foster technical excellence among engineering students. The Lycaeum has been the space where programmers are created through training, mentoring, discussing and debating. </p>

                                    in a lot of technologies without proper aim or plan. Noufal sir’s
                                    guidance and mentorship helped me to focus on the fundamentals
                                    and gave clarity on how to approach software development. The
                                    course provided a strong foundation and looking back I can
                                    see how much it has benefited me in my career. I would highly
                                    recommend budding developers to take this course and benefit
                                    from the immense knowledge and experience of Noufal sir.</p>

                                    as a team. Hats off to Mr.Noufal for his remarkable training
                                    skills. He always took our questions seriously, never dismissed
                                    them as wrong, emphasized good answers and provided useful
                                    examples. The presentations by him were consistently of high
                                    quality and engaging. I admit this was a stepping stone in my
                                    career and would surely recommend to my fellow beings. I have
                                    personally gained a lot of knowledge. It is surely helping me to

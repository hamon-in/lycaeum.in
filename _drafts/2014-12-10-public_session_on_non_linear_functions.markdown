For this months' public session which I'm scheduling on 20th December 2014 (Saturday), I'm planning to discuss a mathematical rather than a programming topic.

I'm planning to do a little class on the behaviour of non linear functions when you iterate them. This is really the starting point for things like [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). We'll talk a little about orbits, fixed and periodic points and how to visualise these using some simple tools. We should be able to see and appreciate points that are attracting, repelling and orbits that are periodic.

This might sound a little technical but apart from basic knowledge of mathematical functions and how to plot them on graphs, you don't need anything to appreciate the concepts behind the topic.

See you all there and do help by spreading the word.

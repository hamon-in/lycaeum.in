This is a time table for the [3 month mentoring course](http://thelycaeum.in/blog/2014/10/31/mentoring_course_starting_again/) which I announced in a previous blog post.

This is structured as an
[inverted classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching) where I first provide the material and an intro. Students are then expected to work on it asking doubts via. email. I'll reply to emails daily. I'll also be on IRC most of the time so that people can stay in touch. At each logical point, we'll have a contact class at Kozhikode to discuss the concepts.

This is a general plan and is not carved in stone. Depending on student requirements and other events, there will be some flexibility.

Hangouts will be around one hour long usually in the late afternoon.  Contact classes will be from 10:00 am to 5:30 pm with a breaks for lunch and tea.

Hangout and contact class time is limited. Please make sure that you come prepared and make full use of the time.

One of things I want to emphasise is that you should use email and other channels to communicate while doing your work. While we have fixed times for hangouts and contact classes, you can (and should) be active on the mailing list and IRC channel to clarify your doubts.

Since this is a batch in between the semester, placement discussions will be put off till you finish your course. I will put you in touch with prospective companies depending on your work on the project.

This is a time table for the 3 month mentoring course which I
announced in a previous blog post.

This is structured as an
[inverted classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching) where
I first provide the material and an intro. Students are then expected
to work on it asking doubts via. email. I'll reply to emails
daily. I'll also be on IRC most of the time so that people can stay in
touch. At each logical point, we'll have a contact class at Kozhikode
to discuss the concepts.

This is a general plan and is not carved in stone. Depending on
student requirements, there will be some flexibility.

Hangouts will be around one hour long. Please come prepared with
questions (email them in advance if possible) so that we can make
maximum use of our time.

Contact classes will be from 10:00 am to 5:30 pm with a breaks for
lunch and tea.

Hangout and contact class time is limited. Please make sure that you
come prepared and make full use of the time.

                                    <p class="card-text">Before attending the Lycaeum mentoring course, I was dabbling
                                        in a lot of technologies without proper aim or plan. Noufal sirâ€™s
                                        guidance and mentorship helped me to focus on the fundamentals
                                        and gave clarity on how to approach software development. The
                                        course provided a strong foundation and looking back I can
                                        see how much it has benefited me in my career. I would highly
                                        recommend budding developers to take this course and benefit
                                        from the immense knowledge and experience of Noufal sir.

                                    <p class="card-text">The programme was great in content and groomed us to work
                                        as a team. Hats off to Mr.Noufal for his remarkable training
                                        skills. He always took our questions seriously, never dismissed
                                        them as wrong, emphasized good answers and provided useful
                                        examples. The presentations by him were consistently of high
                                        quality and engaging. I admit this was a stepping stone in my
                                        career and would surely recommend to my fellow beings. I have
                                        personally gained a lot of knowledge. It is surely helping me to
                                        stay in the industry and to constantly improve myself.</p>
